# Candidate Search

## Overview

This project is a **candidate search application** designed to enhance the hiring process by leveraging TypeScript with React. The application delivers a robust, maintainable, and scalable solution that calls the GitHub API and renders candidate data in the browser.

The backend API, which retrieves data from the GitHub API, was provided, and the front end has been completed, fully integrated with the API, and deployed to **Render**.

## Setup

### GitHub Personal Access Token

To increase the GitHub API rate limit, a personal access token was created following these steps:

1. Follow [GitHubâ€™s instructions for creating a fine-grained personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. The token was added to a `.env` file in the `environment` folder as `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`. An example `.env.EXAMPLE` file was provided for guidance.
